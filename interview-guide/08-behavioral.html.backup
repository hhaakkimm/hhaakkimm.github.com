        <h1>💼 Behavioral Interview Questions</h1>

        <h2>The STAR Method</h2>

        <h3>Framework for Answering</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>S - Situation:</strong> Set the context (when, where, who)</li>
            <li><strong>T - Task:</strong> Describe your responsibility or challenge</li>
            <li><strong>A - Action:</strong> Explain what YOU did (use "I", not "we")</li>
            <li><strong>R - Result:</strong> Share the outcome with metrics if possible</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example Question:</strong> Tell me about a time you solved a complex technical problem.
            <br><br>
            <strong>STAR Answer:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Situation:</strong> "At my previous company, our API was experiencing 500 errors affecting
                    20% of requests during peak traffic."</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> "As the backend lead, I was responsible for diagnosing and resolving the
                    issue within 24 hours to prevent customer churn."</li>
                <li><strong>Action:</strong> "I analyzed server logs and discovered N+1 database queries in user profile
                    loading. I implemented select_related() and added Redis caching for frequently accessed data. I also
                    added database connection pooling to handle concurrent requests better."</li>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> "Error rate dropped to 0.2%, API response time improved from 2.5s to 450ms,
                    and we prevented an estimated $50K in lost revenue. This also established a code review pattern to
                    prevent similar issues."</li>
